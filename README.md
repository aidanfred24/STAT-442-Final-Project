Analysis of Toxics Release Inventory Data from the US Environmental Protection Agency

The US Environmental Protection Agency makes much of its data available to the US public. Of this data, one of the most interesting
is their "Toxics Release Inventory" (TRI). This inventory is an method of tracking the toxic waste management processes and amounts in 
US facilities. Data is reported annually by individual facilities. Chemicals that are required to be reported are generally those that
cause:

* Cancer or other chronic human health effects
* Significant adverse acute human health effects
* Significant adverse environmental effects

This app originally started as a final project for an Exploratory Data Analysis course (STAT 442) at South Dakota State University. 
However, since then it has seen many improvements, including better functionality, user friendliness, and advanced features. Now it 
serves as a fully operational environmental data analysis tool.
